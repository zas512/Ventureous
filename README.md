## About

**Ventureous** is an **AI-powered startup pitch platform** where early-stage founders submit pitches, receive instant **AI analysis powered by Google Gemini**, and connect with a community of investors and builders. Browse and search startup ideas, upvote the best ones, leave feedback in the comments, and build a public founder profile — all on a blazing-fast **Next.js 16 + Sanity CMS** stack.

Every pitch is scored by AI across **clarity, market positioning, and uniqueness**, with actionable suggestions to sharpen the idea before it reaches investors. A fully editable, content-managed homepage and blog round out the experience, making Ventureous both a product and a complete, real-world reference for building a modern full-stack monorepo.

## 📂 Project Structure

Ventureous is an **npm + Turborepo monorepo** with two apps and shared packages:

```text
apps/
  web/      — Next.js 16 frontend (App Router, React 19, Tailwind v4, Turbopack)
  studio/   — Sanity Studio v5 (Vite, styled-components)
packages/
  env/                — Zod-validated environment variables (client + server)
  sanity/             — Sanity client, GROQ queries, live preview, generated types
  ui/                 — Shared Radix + CVA + Tailwind components (shadcn-style)
  logger/             — Structured logger
  typescript-config/  — Shared tsconfigs
```

## 🧰 Getting Started

1. Make sure [Git](https://git-scm.com/downloads), [Node.js 22+](https://nodejs.org/) and [npm 11+](https://www.npmjs.com/) are installed.
2. Fork this repository and clone **your fork**:

   ```bash
  git clone https://github.com/<your-username>/Ventureous.git
  cd Ventureous
   ```

3. Install dependencies:

   ```bash
  npm install
   ```

4. Add environment variables — create `apps/web/.env.local` and `apps/studio/.env.local` (see [Environment Variables](#-environment-variables)).

5. Start both apps:

   ```bash
  npm run dev
   ```

6. Open the frontend at [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) and the Sanity Studio at [http://localhost:3333](http://localhost:3333).

## 🔐 Environment Variables

**`apps/web/.env.local`**

```bash
NEXT_PUBLIC_SANITY_PROJECT_ID=
NEXT_PUBLIC_SANITY_DATASET=
NEXT_PUBLIC_SANITY_API_VERSION=
NEXT_PUBLIC_SANITY_STUDIO_URL=
SANITY_API_READ_TOKEN=
SANITY_API_WRITE_TOKEN=
AUTH_SECRET=
AUTH_GITHUB_ID=
AUTH_GITHUB_SECRET=
GEMINI_API_KEY=
```

**`apps/studio/.env.local`**

```bash
SANITY_STUDIO_PROJECT_ID=
SANITY_STUDIO_DATASET=
SANITY_STUDIO_TITLE=
SANITY_STUDIO_PRESENTATION_URL=
SANITY_STUDIO_API_VERSION=
```

> All variables are validated at startup with Zod via `@workspace/env`. Any new variable must also be added to `turbo.json` `globalEnv` so Vercel cache invalidation works.

## 📜 Scripts

Run from the repo root (Turborepo fans out to both apps):

| Command            | Description                                    |
| ------------------ | ---------------------------------------------- |
| `npm run dev`         | Run web (:3000) and studio (:3333) in dev mode |
| `npm run dev:web`     | Run only the Next.js app                       |
| `npm run dev:studio`  | Run only the Sanity Studio                     |
| `npm run build`       | Production build of all apps                   |
| `npm run lint`        | Lint with Biome / Ultracite                    |
| `npm run format`      | Format and auto-fix                            |
| `npm run check-types` | Type-check with TypeScript                     |

After editing any Sanity schema, regenerate types from `apps/studio`:

```bash
cd apps/studio
npm run extract   # write schema.json
npm run type      # regenerate packages/sanity/src/sanity.types.ts
```

## 🏗 Architecture

- **Content flow** — Schemas live in `apps/studio/schemaTypes/`; GROQ queries in `packages/sanity` are fetched server-side via a `defineLive` wrapper for automatic revalidation. All frontend types are derived from generated Sanity types.
- **Page builder** — An array of typed blocks rendered by `apps/web/src/components/pagebuilder.tsx`, mapping each `_type` to a React component with click-to-edit visual editing.
- **AI analysis** — `apps/web/src/lib/gemini.ts` calls Google Gemini; the response is validated with Zod (clarity / market positioning / uniqueness scores + suggestions) and rendered in the pitch detail view.
- **Auth** — NextAuth v5 with GitHub; on first sign-in the GitHub avatar is uploaded to Sanity and an `author` document is created, with the Sanity author `_id` carried through the session.
